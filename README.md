# AlgoToolBox (WIP)

Minimal collection of DSA snippets and diagrams. Work in progress.

Status: WIP — expect experiments and partial implementations.

Quick run

- Java demo (JDK 11+):

```bash
javac -d out src/Main.java
java -cp out Main
```

- C# demo (requires .NET SDK):

```bash
cd old_csharp_reference
dotnet run
```

Note: The repository contains original C# solutions and a small Java demo. Migration details (C# → Java) are not documented here to keep this repository minimal.
